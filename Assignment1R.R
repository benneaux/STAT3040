# I've used the broom package so that I can easily store the output from
# correlation and normality tests as datasets (Lines 58, 64 & 111). This then 
# makes it simple to recall things like p-values from those tests and print them
# to the console, independent of the rest of the model output. The package is 
# only 1.5Mb and I don't believe that it has many dependencies. 
# Running Lines 7 - 27 will check to see if the package is already installed and
# either load/install the package as required.

#  sample data in $w$ is four times the variance of the sample data in $v$.
