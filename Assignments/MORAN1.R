## 1. Define the 1000 Ã— 2 matrix z.

  z <- matrix(
    nrow = 1000,
    ncol = 2
    )
  
  summary(z)

## 2. Generate two sets of 1000 Standard Normal random variates by using 
##    equations z1 and z2 given in item 20 and store each of them in one 
##    column of matrix z.

  set.seed(2936)
  
  u1 <- runif(1000,0,1)
  u2 <- runif(1000,0,1)
  
  z1 <-  sqrt(-2*log(u1))*cos(2*pi*u2)
  z2 <-  sqrt(-2*log(u1))*sin(2*pi*u2)

  z[,1] <- z1
  z[,2] <- z2

  summary(z)

## 3. Test, statistically, if each column of matrix z is normally distributed at
##    the significance level of 5%.
  
  # Run the test and store output.
  normtest.z1 <- shapiro.test(z[,1])
  
  normtest.z2 <- shapiro.test(z[,2])
  
  z1.p <- normtest.z1$p.value
  if(z1.p > 0.05) {
    print(
      paste(
        "z1 p-value =",
        z1.p,
        " - therefore, z1 is normally distributed"
        )
      )
  } else{
    print(
      paste(
        "z1 p-value =",
        z1.p,
        " - therefore, z1 is not normally distributed"
        )
      )
  }
  
  z2.p <- normtest.z2$p.value
  if(normtest.z2$p.value > 0.05) {
    print(
      paste(
        "z2 p-value =",
        z2.p,
        " - therefore, z2 is normally distributed"
        )
      )
  } else{
    print(
      paste(
        "z2 p-value =",
        z2.p,
        " - therefore, z2 is not normally distributed"
        )
      )
  }
  
##  4. Test, statistically, if two columns of matrix $z$ are uncorrelated at the 
##  significance level of $5%$.
  
  cortest.z <- cor.test(z[,1],z[,2])
  
  z.corr <- cortest.z$p.value
  if(cortest.z$p.value > 0.05) {
    print(
      paste(
        "z.corr p-value =",
        z.corr,
        " - therefore, z1 and z2 are uncorrelated"
      )
    )
  } else{
    print(
      paste(
        "z.corr p-value =",
        z.corr,
        " - therefore, z1 and z2 are correlated"
      )
    )
  }


##  5. Store both columns of matrix $z$ in a long vector, say $v$.
  
  # Create the vector v
    v <- c(z[,1], z[,2])
  
  # Print summary and length to show that the vector has been created correctly.
    summary(v)
    length(v)



##  6. Find the average and variance of the generated data in $v$.

  mean(v)
  var(v)
  
##  7. Define a new vector   $w = 2v + 5$. 
##  Show, numerically, that the average of the sample data in $w$ is equal to 
##  two times the average of the sample data in $v + 5$, and the variance of the 
##  sample data in $w$ is four times the variance of the sample data in $v$.

  # Create the vector and print a short summary to show it exits.
    w <-  2*v + 5 
    summary(w) 

  # Create new variables to store the mean of w and v separately
    avg.w <- mean(w)
    avg.v <- mean(v)

  # Use those variables to show that the stated values are equal.
    diff.avg <- 2*avg.v + 5 - avg.w
    diff.avg

  # Repeat the process for the variance of w and v  
    var.w <- var(w)
    var.v <- var(v)

    diff.var <- 4*var.v - var.w
    diff.var
